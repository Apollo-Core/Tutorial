## Content

### Start

This folder contains the files representing the necessary knowledge about the application which is about to be orchestrated:

- The file ``Caesar.yaml`` (created in the [first part of the tutorial](https://github.com/Apollo-Core/Tutorial/tree/master/Part_1)) which describes the workflow of the application orchestrated in this tutorial
- The file ``functions.py`` containing a standalone implementation of the functionality which is to be deployed as a serverless function usable by Apollo

### Result

TBD, but it's gonna be the ``caesar_mappings_aws.json`` file -- don't forget to remove the links.
